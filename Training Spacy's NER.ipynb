We would like to improve the accuracy of these preexisting tags. There is also a monetary quantity (sesenta e cinco ducados) that we would like the model to identify. You might be interested in adding new tags to a preexisting model. The Spacy medium Spanish model includes tags for PER (person), LOC (location), ORG (organization) and MISC (miscellaneous) entities.

    "You should aspire to perfect data tagging. This apparently simple goal will actually require some thought, as the edges of entities are often unclear. It is helpful to ask yourself: if this were the model's output, would I be happy with the result? Make entities as short as possible, and tag related entities separately (their relationships can be modeled after). Tags must not overlap (take special care if using Dataturks, because their automated selection of similar words, though helpful overall, often causes this issue). If several people are doing the tagging, make sure you share a common set of criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used [Dataturks](https://dataturks.com) for elaborating our own training data (downloadable here). It is open-source and results in a format easily importable into Spacy. To speed the tagging process, we first ran the Spacy model on our untagged texts, generating a prior annotated version (with many errors) that we uploaded onto Dataturks (instructions here). We then edited the tags and exported the file. Dataturks produces a file in a slightly different format than Spacy, but they provide a function for converting between formats (we have done this in a different notebook, available here)."

It is worth noting that the measurements above will to some extent depend on the ways the data was shuffled; so one iteration may perform better or worse depending on which texts were taken as training data. We have created a notebook in which you can run several trials and develop an idea of the average values of these indicators and their variance. \n",

As previously stated, models are often trained on modern texts of very defined genres, like news or wikipedia articles. Your documents may have characteristics, such as spelling variation, differences in tokenization or differences in sentence fragmentation that could differ from the texts the model was originally trained on. This is especially true of historical documents and those taken from social media. Normalizing your own documents could improve performance. We have another document that helps you include a normalization dictionary in your pipeline before training, and similar adaptations could be made to the tokenizer and sentence fragmenter.\n",
