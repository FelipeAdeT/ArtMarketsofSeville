# NER Resources

Named Entity Recognition is the process of extracting and labeling real-world entities with proper names in a set of text. Examples of entities to be extracted can be people, locations, organizations, and even monetary amounts, dates, and a long etcetera of options.

Statistical models for NER are trained on corpuses of texts, those readily available online are usually trained on modern samples of news articles or on similarly standardized genres. We have found that these models can be used on historical texts, but results could greatly be improved.

In this project, we have used [Spacy's medium Spanish Model](http://www.spacy.io) to analyze historical Spanish texts, and we have experimented with several ways to improve its predictions.
