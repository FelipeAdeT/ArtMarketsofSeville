# ArtMarketsofSeville
The Art Markets of Seville Database. Compiles historical archival sources from Sevillian archives on painting, sculpture and other crafts, using NPL to mine them for information such as actors, locations, dates, objects and money amounts.  In this repository, I keep resources and code employed in the creation of the database.
